## HW8; Score: 16/20

Fellas, this is a very comprehensive project and I'm a bit worried about the scale of it. I would narrow your ideas to one or two specific things that you intend to do. Think about what you can do computationally with regard to the Zeeman effect, which is inherently quantum. I'd hope there's a bit more about E&M in this, but if you are really interested in it, that's fine. But think about what kinds of computational tasks you could do to explore the Zeeman effect. Much of this work is diagonalizing matrices, so there might be some interesting problems that you can introduce here where the diagonalizaton is better done using a computer (for example). So, overall think more narrowed and more focused. Also, remember this isn't a paper, it's a poster presentation of your analysis.
