Fellas, I'm glad that you are both trying to balance the workload between the two of you, but make sure it doesn't get overly loaded on one or the other of you. What I got from the document that you wrote up and poking around the other folders is that you have a lot of things ready to work on, but I'm still a touch unclear on the models as the calculations folder doesn't seem to have anything completed in it. I understand that you are going to be looking at the Stark effect and using pertubation theory, but I'm still unclear as to where the computer comes in specifically. I can think of a few ways, but I'm wondering what you intend.

Fellas, I do think that your project is getting better and more narrowly scoped, which is good. I'm a bit concerned about the ambitious nature of your project, so I'm hoping that as you work through the first example of it, which should be a reproduction of some exisiting work, right, that you start to see what you might further limit your work to. I'm also wondering about your more detailed timeline given that Eric will be visiting grad schools and such. In this next week, I'd really like to see the models that you plan to use and implement with some discussion of how you intend to do that work.

## HW8; Score: 16/20

Fellas, this is a very comprehensive project and I'm a bit worried about the scale of it. I would narrow your ideas to one or two specific things that you intend to do. Think about what you can do computationally with regard to the Zeeman effect, which is inherently quantum. I'd hope there's a bit more about E&M in this, but if you are really interested in it, that's fine. But think about what kinds of computational tasks you could do to explore the Zeeman effect. Much of this work is diagonalizing matrices, so there might be some interesting problems that you can introduce here where the diagonalizaton is better done using a computer (for example). So, overall think more narrowed and more focused. Also, remember this isn't a paper, it's a poster presentation of your analysis.
