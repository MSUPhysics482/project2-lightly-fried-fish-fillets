## HW10; Score: 16/20

Fellas, I'm glad that you are both trying to balance the workload between the two of you, but make sure it doesn't get overly loaded on one or the other of you. What I got from the document that you wrote up and poking around the other folders is that you have a lot of things ready to work on, but I'm still a touch unclear on the models as the calculations folder doesn't seem to have anything completed in it. I understand that you are going to be looking at the Stark effect and using pertubation theory, but I'm still unclear as to where the computer comes in specifically. I can think of a few ways, but I'm wondering what you intend.
