## HW11; Score: 16/20

Fellas, I can see that you've made a fair amount of progress on your analytical work and that you appear to have a direction for your continued analysis. I also think you have some minimal code that gets you moving on looking at the shift due to Zeeman. I guess I'm still wondering how you plan to put it all together. What's the connection between the analytical work and what you plan to do computationally. It appears that you are staged to look at the effect of a simply increasing magnetic field. Is that the plan? This coming week if you could give me a little more sense of what you intend to do with the work you have completed thus far, that'd be helpful.
