	{\Large E \& M II - Homework 13}
\end{center}

We believe that we can pose the questions: How do magnetic fields effect quantum energy levels? and How can magnetic fields affect electric fields/ Can they induce the stark effect?  Posing these questions provides a clear reasoning behind our project.  I think that generally we are set on the mathematics and figures, but we would like your feedback on how we can make this a complete project.  That is, would us posing these questions help answer your concerns.  If not, then what would you suggest that we ask to give us a more complete project?
